- Add,read, update and delete income and expenses.
- Monitor and control their budget.
- Set percentage for specific category they want to spend money on and compare it with actual spendings.
- Set and manage recurring transactions based on intervals defined by user. 

### Using this application, users can easily manage their personal finances and track recurring transactions to ensure they are in control of their budget.

## Tests
### Each key component of the application is tested to ensure functionality and compliance to the expected behaviour. Testing is carried out using pytest and unittest with object mocking. The test coverage is over 80%, ensuring that the application performs reliably under various scenarios.
